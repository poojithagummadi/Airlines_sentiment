ðŸ“Œ Overview

The **Airline Tweet Sentiment Classifier** is a **Streamlit web application** that uses a **pre-trained NLP model** to classify the sentiment of airline-related tweets as **Positive**, **Neutral**, or **Negative**.

It leverages the **[`cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest`](https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest)** model from Hugging Face, which has already been fine-tuned on large-scale Twitter data for sentiment analysis.

This project focuses on:
- Integrating a pre-trained model into a **user-friendly web interface**.
- Providing **real-time sentiment analysis** without needing to train a model.
- Demonstrating how to use **Hugging Face Transformers** with **Streamlit**.
